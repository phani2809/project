                        <li>2 cups idly rice</li>
                        <li>1 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
                        <li>1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds</li>
                        <li>Salt to taste</li>
                        <li>Water, as needed</li>

                    <h2>Recipe</h2>
                    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rinse the idly rice and urad dal separately until the water runs clear. Soak the rice and dal along with fenugreek seeds in water for at least 6-8 hours or overnight.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drain the soaked urad dal and fenugreek seeds. Grind them in a blender or wet grinder, adding water gradually, to make a smooth and fluffy batter.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Drain the soaked rice and grind it to a slightly coarse batter, adding water as needed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Combine both batters in a large bowl, add salt, and mix well. The batter should be of dropping consistency. Cover the bowl and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or until it doubles in volume.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once fermented, gently stir the batter. Grease the idly molds with oil and pour the batter into each mold, filling them about 3/4 full.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Steam the idlis in an idly steamer or pressure cooker (without the whistle) for about 10-12 minutes on medium heat, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Remove the idly molds from the steamer and let them cool for a few minutes. Use a spoon to gently remove the idlis from the molds.</p>
                    <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Serve hot with chutney and sambar.</p>
                    <h2>Time Required</h2>
                    <p>Preparation Time: 20 minutes (excluding soaking and fermentation time)</p>
                    <p>Cooking Time: 15 minutes</p>
